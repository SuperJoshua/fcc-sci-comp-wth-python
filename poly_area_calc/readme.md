# Build a Polygon Area Calculator

In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a `Rectangle` class and a `Square` class. The `Square` class should be a subclass of `Rectangle`, and inherit its methods and attributes.

## Rectangle class

When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with `width` and `height` attributes. The class should also contain the following methods:

- `set_width`
- `set_height`
- `get_area`: Returns area (`width * height`)
- `get_perimeter`: Returns perimeter (`2 * width + 2 * height`)
- `get_diagonal`: Returns diagonal (`(width ** 2 + height ** 2) ** .5`)
- `get_picture`: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of '\*'. The number of lines should be equal to the height and the number of '\*' in each line should be equal to the width. There should be a new line (`\n`) at the end of each line. If the width or height is larger than 50, this should return the string: `'Too big for picture.'`.
- `get_amount_inside`: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. Returns the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4.

Additionally, if an instance of a `Rectangle` is represented as a string, it should look like: `'Rectangle(width=5, height=10)'`.

## Square class

The `Square` class should be a subclass of `Rectangle`. When a `Square` object is created, a single side length is passed in. The `__init__` method should store the side length in both the `width` and `height` attributes from the `Rectangle` class.

The `Square` class should be able to access the `Rectangle` class methods but should also contain a `set_side` method. If an instance of a `Square` is represented as a string, it should look like: `'Square(side=9)'`.

Additionally, the `set_width` and `set_height` methods on the `Square` class should set both the width and height.

## Usage example

```py
rect = Rectangle(10, 5)
print(rect.get_area())
rect.set_height(3)
print(rect.get_perimeter())
print(rect)
print(rect.get_picture())

sq = Square(9)
print(sq.get_area())
sq.set_side(4)
print(sq.get_diagonal())
print(sq)
print(sq.get_picture())

rect.set_height(8)
rect.set_width(16)
print(rect.get_amount_inside(sq))
```

That code should return:

```bash
50
26
Rectangle(width=10, height=3)
**********
**********
**********

81
5.656854249492381
Square(side=4)
****
****
****
****

8
```

## Tests

- The Square class should be a subclass of the Rectangle class.
- The Square class should be a distinct class from the Rectangle class.
- A square object should be an instance of the Square class and the Rectangle class.
- The string representation of Rectangle(3, 6) should be 'Rectangle(width=3, height=6)'.
- The string representation of Square(5) should be 'Square(side=5)'.
- Rectangle(3, 6).get_area() should return 18.
- Square(5).get_area() should return 25.
- Rectangle(3, 6).get_perimeter() should return 18.
- Square(5).get_perimeter() should return 20.
- Rectangle(3, 6).get_diagonal() should return 6.708203932499369.
- Square(5).get_diagonal() should return 7.0710678118654755.
- An instance of the Rectangle class should have a different string representation after setting new values.
- An instance of the Square class should have a different string representation after setting new values by using .set_side().
- An instance of the Square class should have a different string representation after setting new values by using .set_width() or set_height().
- The .get_picture() method should return a different string representation of a Rectangle instance.
- The .get_picture() method should return a different string representation of a Square instance.
- The .get_picture() method should return the string 'Too big for picture.' if the width or height attributes are larger than 50.
- Rectangle(15,10).get_amount_inside(Square(5)) should return 6.
- Rectangle(4,8).get_amount_inside(Rectangle(3, 6)) should return 1.
- Rectangle(2,3).get_amount_inside(Rectangle(3, 6)) should return 0.
